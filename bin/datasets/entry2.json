{"div": "<p>The environment for investment banking and trading has been excellent across the board, and 2006 will be remembered in financial circles as an historic year. The year isn't even over, and it has already set records for mergers-and-acquisitions volume and for biggest leveraged buyouts (see BusinessWeek.com, 11/7/06, <a itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemprop=\"StoryLink\" href=\"/news/terminal/O1N9TA6JTSER\" class=\"terminal-news-story\" target=\"_blank\"><meta itemprop=\"active\" content=\"true\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\"><meta itemprop=\"type\" content=\"StoryLink\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\"><meta itemprop=\"suid\" content=\"O1N9TA6JTSER\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">\"The Money Behind the Private Equity Boom\"</a>).</p>"},
{"div": "<p>Yet the financial results that Goldman Sachs (GS) reported on Dec. 12 for its fourth fiscal quarter were impressive, even given the strong environment. Goldman far exceeded expectations\u2014and set a record of its own\u2014by reporting a profit of $9.5 billion for the fiscal year on revenues of $37.6 billion. That's also the biggest profit in the history of the securities industry. Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said the profit nearly matched the combined earnings of 2004 and 2005, which were records in their own right. Its return on equity was a stunning 33%. \"This was a remarkable year for Goldman Sachs,\" Viniar said on a conference call with investors.</p>"},
{"div": "<p aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">The results reflect a strong environment. Stocks have moved higher since the summer, and the global economy remains solid, despite slowing growth, Viniar said. He said the combination of a decent economy and strong CEO confidence boosted investment banking and created a good environment for trading. Revenue from equity trading soared 105% to $1.23 billion.</p>"},
{"div": "<p aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">Investors were cautious, in part because it's hard to imagine that even Goldman can keep growing at such a pace. The stock price fell $1.46 to $201.06. The shares have climbed 60% this year. Michael Hecht, an analyst who follows Goldman for Banc of America Securities, said he was maintaining his neutral rating on the stock \"because we are hard-pressed to see Goldman Sachs top the 33% return on equity they generated in '06.\" He expects Goldman's ROE to drop to 26% in 2007 and 22% in 2008.</p>"},
{"div": "<p aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">Hecht is projecting that Goldman will have net earnings of $9.1 billion in fiscal 2007, on revenues of $36.9 billion. In 2008, he is forecasting profits of $8.7 billion, as revenues slip slightly to $36.5 billion.</p>"},
{"div": "<p aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">Still, there are signs that 2007 should be another strong year for Goldman. Viniar said the backlog of investment banking deals is higher now than it was at the beginning of the year. In addition, CEO confidence and the economic outlook remain solid. \"Conditions should remain strong in 2007,\" he said.</p>"},
{"div": "<p aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">Global economic growth is expected to slow next year, but still continue at more than 2% for the year. Goldman is well positioned in strategically important markets around the world, particularly in China. The firm pulled in $949 million alone from its investment in the Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China. Viniar said Goldman now derives 45% of its revenue from China and other markets outside the U.S. and that revenue from abroad is growing faster than revenue from the U.S.</p>"},
{"div": "<p aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">Goldman's culture also contributes to its success. The company uses its profits to hire and retain what it believes to be the best minds in finance. It has spent $16.5 billion, or about 42% of its revenue for 2006, on salaries, benefits, and bonuses, which run into the tens of millions of dollars for top bankers and traders. Its stars are highly coveted by other businesses and the government. U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson was lured from Goldman in June (see BusinessWeek.com, 6/12/06, <a itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemprop=\"StoryLink\" href=\"/news/terminal/O1TE4W6JTSEP\" class=\"terminal-news-story\" target=\"_blank\"><meta itemprop=\"active\" content=\"true\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\"><meta itemprop=\"type\" content=\"StoryLink\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\"><meta itemprop=\"suid\" content=\"O1TE4W6JTSEP\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">\"Mr. Risk Goes to Washington\"</a>).</p>"},
{"div": "<p aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">The quarterly results mark a strong debut for Paulson's replacement as CEO, Lloyd Blankfein. He is a trader who worked his way up through the ranks at Goldman, and the firm's emphasis these days reflects his expertise.</p>"},
{"div": "<p aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">An increasing share of the firm's revenues are coming from trading. Private equity was another big driver of growth. Revenue from that business and related markets rose 64% to $1.4 billion. Investment banking revenue rose 42% to $1.3 billion.</p>"},
{"div": "<p aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">But equity trading was in a class by itself, with its 100% growth. Quarterly revenue from bond and currency trading rose 58% to $3.1 billion. Trading included some riskier bets on hedge funds, not all of which paid off. Its Global Alpha fund, which rose about 40% last year, is down about 10% this year.</p>"},
{"div": "<p aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">Goldman isn't the only player to have a rocky year in the hedge fund business. Average returns are about 9%, industry executives say. That's hardly the kind of payback investors expect, particularly in a year when the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 has returned 13%. And hedge funds carry higher risks than traditional equity investments, as evidenced by blowups such as the collapse of energy trader Amaranth Advisors (see BusinessWeek.com, 9/20/06, <a itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemprop=\"StoryLink\" href=\"/news/terminal/O1TRPK6JTSE8\" class=\"terminal-news-story\" target=\"_blank\"><meta itemprop=\"active\" content=\"true\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\"><meta itemprop=\"type\" content=\"StoryLink\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\"><meta itemprop=\"suid\" content=\"O1TRPK6JTSE8\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">\"Are There More Amaranths Lurking?\"</a>).</p>"},
{"div": "<p aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">Viniar said Goldman and other hedge funds won't be scared off by recent volatility, either. He said it's true hedge funds reduced their debt levels after the Amaranth blowup and the summer stock boom. But he said that hedge funds are still growing as an asset class. And if the markets remain strong, hedge fund players \"will probably start to increase risk again,\" he said.</p>"},
{"div": "<p aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: none;\">As Goldman celebrates its record year in 2006, it will have to work harder than ever to keep up the pace in the years ahead.</p>"}
